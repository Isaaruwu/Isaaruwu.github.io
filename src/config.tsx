			<p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹</p><br></br>
			<p>
				I'm <span className="highlighted">Ismail Aarab</span>,  soon to be a 
				<span className="highlighted"> graduate with a Bachelor's
				degree in Software Engineering from Polytechnique MontrÃ©al</span>. With a strong foundation in 
				software development and a passion for continuous learning, I thrive on creating innovative solutions to complex problems.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>
			Throughout my academic journey, I have specialized in automating tasks through scripting 
			and have developed a keen interest in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. My projects, 
			both in school and during my spare time, have allowed me to gain hands-on experience in these fields. 
			Additionally, I enjoy designing and building full-stack web applications, 
			constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
				Here's a list of some of the technologies I've been working with recently 
				(it's only from my public repos, so it's not exhaustive ðŸ˜‰ ):
